## Personal Motivation

This project will serve the purpose of allowing me to practise working with React and gain an in-depth understanding of what it takes to build fast, stable and optimixed React applications. A grasp of the fundamentals of UI/UX will also be earned.

## Architecture and State management

The above named functionalities will require a better state management  other than *usestate*(). *Redux* will  be made use of at a later stage when most of the functionality has been achieved. Currently however, the simple state management provided by React will suffice.

*Separation of concerns* as a principle will be utilised in the development. Modularization will be utilised in the form of components and separate function files. This is in the hope of improving readability and development.

## Third Party APIs and content

The development of this project relies heavily on the following third party APIs. ...
* [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev)
* [Free Quotes API](https://type.fit/api/quotes)
* [FreePik Vectors and Stock Photos](https://www.freepik.com)
